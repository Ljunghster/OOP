# OOP
Object Oriented Programming
using strings and arrays are object oriented programming?
Every single data type in javascript are all objects, all OOP

*****let str = "hello World" ===>>> quotes are string
There are 7 string methods?


let dog = {
    name: "beef"
} ===>>> brackets make this an object method?

All part of the object prototype. EVERYTHING IN JAVASCRIPT IS AN OBJECT

Concept of dry programming?

Constructors: allow you to build a prototype of certain data to be used, replicated, and to define??? Look up later

Three ways to approaching contructors
1.) root in 
2.) something to do with React.js
3.) factory function

inheritance: the way we inherit certain properties from other constructors. Factory removes this?

__proto__: prototpye for what an object is defined by from Javascript (inheritance web is where in the console this is shown)

missed info on print function

how to use shuffle-array

class syntax=declaring constructors by creating a class
MUCH BETTER to use class syntax
